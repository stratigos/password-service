# Password Service

### Description

We should be as helpful to our users as possible. When selecting passwords we
should tell them if they've selected a good password. Your job is to implement
a system to help our users select a good password.

* Implement a back-end service that will receive the password and return either `weak`,
  `ok` or `strong.`
* Implement a front end that calls the back-end service to measure the password and 
  show the user the strength of their password as they are typing.

### Implementation Notes

Acceptable implementation languages are Ruby, Python, .NET, Javascript, Java, and Scala. You may use any language framework readily available to you - Rails, Sinatra or Express.js for example.

> If using an application framework merge in the basic scafolding into master. Then create a second PR with just your work.

This is your chance to demonstrate your understanding of sound design and architecture principles. Any design decisions not specified herein are fair game but expect to be able to defend and explain your choices. Business rules/requirements may change, build accordingly.

Completed projects must include a README with enough instructions for evaluators to build and run the code. Bonus points for builds which require minimal manual steps.

This project should take a maximum of 4 hours to complete. This should be production quality code, but do not get hung up on scaling or persistence issues. This is a project used to evaluate your design, discipline and coding skills only.
